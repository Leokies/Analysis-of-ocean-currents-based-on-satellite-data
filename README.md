# Analysis-of-ocean-currents-based-on-satellite-data
In this project I use python to characterized the circulation patterns in the Gulf of Cadiz based on satellite altimetry. Which are briefly described.

-Calculation of geostrophic currents based on satellite altimetry data:

    The surface geostrophic velocity is proportional to the slope of the ocean surface topography. This allows indirectly to observe geostrophic circulation through the     measurement of the ocean’s topography by satellites. 
    The ocean can be considered as geostrophic balanced in an approximation. This means that the horizontal pressure gradient is equal to the Coriolis force under           certain simplifications.
    These simplifications include the following assumptions:
    •	the flow has no acceleration
    •	only the horizontal velocity is considered
    •	the only external force is gravity
    •	friction is negligible
    Due to these simplifications, only two terms of the momentum equation remain relevant: the pressure gradient and the Coriolis force. The geostrophic approximation       leads to a simple relation between surface slope and surface current.
